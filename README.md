# Hey, Iâ€™m Bigya! ðŸ‘‹  

I **build things that users love and businesses rely on**â€”high-performance **web apps**, **AI-driven solutions**, and **seamless user experiences**.  
With **5+ years of experience** in **full-stack engineering**, I specialize in **`React`**, **`TypeScript`**, **`Python`**, **`Node.js`**, and **`AI-powered applications`** that bridge the gap between **technology and real-world impact**.  

## ðŸš€ Recent Work  
Built an **AI-powered transcription system** for a **non-profit**, leveraging **`Whisper`**, **`TensorFlow`**, and **`Python`** to make **historical records 200% more accessible**â€”transforming **raw audio into structured, searchable data**.  
ðŸ”— Check it out here: [**transcription-system**](https://github.com/bigyaa).  

## ðŸ’¡ Beyond Code  
Iâ€™m exploring **Edge Computing research**, optimizing **data workflows**, and continuously refining **how AI integrates with scalable web applications**.  

## ðŸ”Ž Whatâ€™s Next?  
Iâ€™m looking for **opportunities** where I can apply **AI, web engineering, and creative problem-solving** to build **smart, efficient, and meaningful products**.
