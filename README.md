### Hi there! (:

I'm Bigya, a computer science graduate with a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.

🔭 I recently completed my Capstone Project, ["transcription-system"](https://github.com/bigyaa/transcription-system) where I developed an efficient and scalable solution for transcribing and diarizing bulks of recordings. You can explore more details in my top pinned repository.

🌱 Currently, I'm working on a research paper about Edge Computing with one of my professors. Hoping to get it published by December.🤞🏻

💼 I'm actively seeking job opportunities to apply my web development, machine learning, and data analytics skills to create impactful solutions.

📫 Feel free to contact me at bigya.in.tech@gmail.com (new email @).

I am looking forward to connecting and collaborating with fellow tech enthusiasts. 🚀
