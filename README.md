## Hey, I’m Bigya! 👋

I build things that users love and businesses rely on.—high-performance web apps, AI-driven solutions, and seamless user experiences. With 5+ years of experience in full-stack engineering, I specialize in React, TypeScript, Node.js, and AI-powered applications that bridge the gap between technology and real-world impact.

🚀 Recent Work: Built an AI-powered transcription system for a non-profit, leveraging Whisper, TensorFlow, and Python to make historical records 200% more accessible—transforming raw audio into structured, searchable data. Check it out here: [“transcription-system”](https://github.com/bigyaa/transcription-system).

💡 Beyond Code: I’m exploring Edge Computing research, optimizing data workflows, and continuously refining how AI integrates with scalable web applications.

🔎 What’s Next? I’m looking for opportunities where I can apply AI, web engineering, and creative problem-solving to build smart, efficient, and meaningful products.

📬 Let’s connect! Reach me at bigya.in.tech@gmail.com—always open to discussing exciting projects, new ideas, or just connecting.
