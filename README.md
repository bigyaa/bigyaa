##Hello there! 😊

I’m Bigya, a software engineer with 5 years of experience under my belt. I hold a Master’s and Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, and I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems.

I recently completed an MVP for a non-profit organization called [“transcription-system”](https://github.com/bigyaa/transcription-system). In this project, I designed and developed a highly efficient and scalable solution for transcribing and diarizing a significant volume of recordings. For more details, please refer to my top pinned repository. I am currently working on some exciting feature enhancements that I will incorporate into this branch once I complete them.

🌱 I’m currently working on a research paper about Edge Computing with one of my professors. I’m hoping to get it published by December! 🤞🏻

💼 I’m on the lookout for job opportunities where I can use my web development, machine learning, and data analytics skills to create awesome solutions.

📧 Feel free to reach out to me at bigya.in.tech@gmail.com (new email address).
