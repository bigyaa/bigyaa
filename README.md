### Hi there! (:

I'm Bigya, a computer science graduate with both a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.

ðŸ”­ I recently completed my Capstone Project, ["isc-transcription"](https://github.com/bigyaa/isc-transcription) where I developed an efficient and scalable solution for transcribing and diarizing thousands of recordings. You can explore more details in my top pinned repository.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm enhancing my skill set with a certification in Advanced Data Analytics by Google, focusing on data analysis and interpretation.

ðŸ’¼ I'm actively seeking job opportunities to apply my expertise in computer science, machine learning, and data analytics to create impactful solutions.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me at bigyabajracharya@gmail.com.

Looking forward to connecting and collaborating with fellow tech enthusiasts. ðŸš€
