### Hi there 

 
I'm Bigya, a graduate computer science student at ETSU, passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm immersed in my Capstone Project, "isc-transcription," aimed at devising an efficient and scalable solution for transcribing and diarizing a multitude of recordings. You can find more details on this project in my top pinned repository.

ðŸŒ± Additionally, I'm pursuing certification in Advanced Data Analytics by Google, expanding my knowledge and skills in data analysis and interpretation.

ðŸ“« Want to get in touch? Feel free to reach out to me at bigyabajracharya@gmail.com.

âš¡ Fun fact: I randomly started learning German on Duolingo. Surprisingly, what started as a random endeavor has turned into a 234-streak commitment!

ðŸ’¼ I'm currently seeking job opportunities where I can apply my skills and knowledge in computer science and data analytics to make a meaningful impact.

Looking forward to connecting and collaborating with fellow enthusiasts in the tech realm. ðŸš€
